## v0.5.0 - The Universal Editor Update

### ‚ú® New Features & Major Improvements

-   **Language Selector**: A dropdown menu has been added to the editor toolbar, allowing users to manually change the language for syntax highlighting for any code file.
-   **Markdown by Default**: New documents created via the "New Document" button now default to the Markdown language type, enabling the live preview and rich text features immediately.

## v0.4.0 - The Logging & Stability Update

This release introduces comprehensive action logging, a redesigned logger panel, and significant improvements to the database backup feature.

### ‚ú® New Features & Major Improvements

-   **Comprehensive Action Logging**: Every user action‚Äîincluding button clicks, menu selections, and commands‚Äîis now logged to the Application Log. This provides a clear audit trail and makes debugging significantly easier.
-   **Integrated Logger Panel**: The logger panel has been redesigned to integrate seamlessly into the main window. When opened, it pushes the main content area up instead of overlapping it, ensuring all controls remain visible and accessible.
-   **Compressed Backups**: The database backup feature now uses Gzip compression, significantly reducing the size of backup files (saved with a `.db.gz` extension).

### üêõ Bug Fixes

-   **Backup Functionality**: Fixed a critical bug that prevented the database backup feature from running correctly.

## v0.3.0 - The Layout Update

This release focuses on improving the sidebar layout and user interaction, making it more flexible and intuitive.

-   **Resizable Templates Panel:** The 'Templates' panel in the sidebar is now resizable. Users can drag the horizontal splitter to adjust the panel's height, providing more space for documents when needed.
-   **Streamlined UI:** The 'New from Template' button has been moved from the bottom of the sidebar to the 'Documents' header as a dedicated icon button. This creates a cleaner, more consistent, and always-visible access point for creating documents from templates.

## v0.2.0 - The Workflow Update

This version introduces significant workflow enhancements, giving users more explicit control over versioning and document organization.

### ‚ú® New Features & Major Improvements

-   **Manual Version Control:**
    -   **"Save Version" Button:** Replaced the automatic versioning system with a dedicated "Save Version" button in the editor. A new version is now created only when the user explicitly saves, preventing history clutter.
    -   **Version Deletion:** Users can now select and delete one or more old versions from the history view, providing full control over the document's timeline.
-   **Enhanced Node Management:**
    -   **New Subfolder:** A "New Subfolder" button has been added, allowing for the creation of nested folders directly within the selected folder.
    -   **Duplicate Selection:** A "Duplicate" button allows for the deep copying of one or more selected documents or folders, including all content and sub-items.
-   **UI & Terminology Polish:**
    -   **"Document" Terminology:** The application has been updated to use the term "document" instead of "prompt" throughout the UI and documentation, better reflecting its purpose.
    -   **Sticky Sidebar Toolbar:** The "Documents" action toolbar is now sticky, remaining visible and accessible when scrolling through a long list of items.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

-   **Editor Stability:** Fixed a critical bug that made the editor unresponsive after a state management refactor.
-   **Node Reordering:** Corrected a bug where the "Move Up" button for a node in the sidebar did not work.
-   **AI Title Generation:** Fixed an issue where generating a title with AI would clear any unsaved text in the editor.
