# GUI Quality Validation Plan and Test Report

## 1. Prioritized Test Scenarios

The following test matrix reflects the current Electron preview experience that runs fully in-browser with a sample workspace. Scenarios focus on the highest risk UX areas that are shippable without a backend. Prioritization considers user impact and the likelihood of regression (P1 = highest).

| Priority | Scenario | Objective | Test Steps | Expected Outcome | Environment | Execution Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Application boot and sample workspace load | Verify the renderer initializes, seeds sample data, and shows no blocking errors. | 1. Launch the static preview build. 2. Wait for repository init. 3. Observe sidebar/tree and status bar. | Sample workspace and templates render; no fatal error banner. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headless), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Preview build cannot be generated because `npm install` fails (node-plantuml requires downloading `viz.js`, which is unreachable in the current offline environment). |
| P1 | Document creation and autosave persistence | Ensure new documents retain edits across reloads. | 1. Click **Create New Document**. 2. Enter unique text. 3. Reload app. 4. Reopen the created doc. | Edited content persists after reload and tab switch. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headless), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Depends on successful preview build; prerequisites unavailable. |
| P1 | Layout responsiveness at critical breakpoints | Validate sidebar and editor adapt between desktop/tablet/phone widths. | 1. Load app at 1280px. 2. Resize to 768px. 3. Resize to 375px. | Navigation remains accessible; editor readable with no clipped content. | Desktop, Chromium 139 & WebKit 17 (headless), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Requires running UI preview; assets not compiled due to dependency install failure. |
| P1 | Keyboard navigation starting focus | Confirm first focusable element is reachable via keyboard with visible outline. | 1. Load app. 2. Press `Tab` repeatedly. | Focus shifts from the body to search input (or primary CTA) with accessible outline. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headless), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Preview not available; see environment limitation above. |
| P1 | Global layout & typography consistency | Validate that typography scale, spacing, and iconography align between sidebar, header, editor, and preview panes. | 1. Capture screenshots of each major panel at 1280px. 2. Compare font sizes, padding, and icon sizes against the design tokens. 3. Toggle between light/dark (if available) to spot mismatches. | Panels use consistent typography scale, grid spacing, and iconography with no stray font fallbacks or misaligned badges. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headed), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Screenshot capture requires a compiled build; build step failed. |
| P1 | Editor toolbar theming & state coherence | Ensure toolbar buttons, dropdowns, and toggle states present consistent hover/active/disabled styles. | 1. Hover and click each toolbar control. 2. Toggle split preview modes. 3. Validate tooltip alignment and focus rings. | Toolbar controls exhibit consistent theming, focus outlines, and disabled states across modes. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headed), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – UI cannot be launched without build artifacts. |
| P1 | Modal/toast visual system check | Validate dialog modals (Refine with AI) and toast notifications (autosave/status) align with design spacing, elevation, and animation. | 1. Trigger Refine modal and autosave toast (mock autosave success). 2. Inspect overlay opacity, shadows, and border radius. 3. Dismiss and confirm motion timing. | Overlays respect spacing tokens, accessible contrast, and close gracefully without layout jumps. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headed), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Requires running UI preview; blocked by dependency install failure. |
| P1 | Add Markdown document with live preview | Confirm the default Markdown template saves, renders, and previews correctly. | 1. Create new document (auto .md). 2. Add headings, lists, fenced code, Mermaid block. 3. Save and reload. | Markdown syntax renders in both editor and preview; Mermaid graph displays via renderer after reload. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headless), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Test documents cannot be created without functioning preview environment. |
| P1 | Add HTML document with preview parity | Validate HTML documents render in preview panel with sandboxing. | 1. Duplicate template to `.html`. 2. Insert semantic tags, inline styles, script tag. 3. Reload and inspect preview sandbox. | HTML renders with expected styles while scripts stay sandboxed; editor retains syntax highlighting. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headed), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Preview unavailable; blocked on dependency installation. |
| P1 | Add PlantUML document preview | Ensure standalone `.puml` diagrams generate renders. | 1. Create new doc named `architecture.puml`. 2. Paste sample diagram. 3. Confirm renderer loads image. | PlantUML preview shows diagram thumbnail; errors surface if syntax invalid. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headless), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – PlantUML renderer assets missing because `node-plantuml` post-install script could not download `viz.js`. |
| P1 | Add PDF document preview | Validate PDF assets display in preview frame. | 1. Upload/import sample `.pdf`. 2. Open from sidebar. 3. Scroll through pages. | PDF renders with pagination and zoom controls; no console errors. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headed), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Preview environment not runnable without build artifacts. |
| P1 | Add image asset preview (PNG/JPG) | Confirm image files render with metadata and scaling controls. | 1. Import sample `.png` and `.jpg`. 2. Open previews. 3. Resize viewport. | Image previews scale responsively, maintain aspect ratio, and show filename metadata. | Desktop, Chromium 139 & WebKit 17 (headed), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – UI preview build blocked. |
| P1 | Add plaintext document workflow | Validate `.txt` documents respect monospace styling and AI tooling limits. | 1. Create new document and set extension `.txt`. 2. Enter long-form text. 3. Trigger AI refine (should be available). | Plaintext uses monospace font, retains soft wrap, and AI actions stay enabled. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headless), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Dependent on preview build completion; blocked. |
| P2 | Template preview rendering | Validate template list interactions and visual consistency. | 1. Expand **Templates**. 2. Select **Creative Story Starter**. | Template detail opens with typography intact; destructive actions clearly styled. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headless), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Preview build artifacts unavailable. |
| P2 | Status bar connection messaging | Ensure offline/error states surface clearly without blocking editing. | 1. Launch preview build (no providers configured). 2. Observe status bar messaging. | Connection warning displayed with non-blocking styling. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headless), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Cannot verify without running UI. |
| P2 | Cross-view iconography audit | Confirm icons in sidebar, toolbar, context menus, and status bar use the same library weights and alignment. | 1. Compare icons across views at 1x and 2x zoom. 2. Inspect pixel alignment via dev tools grid. | Icons render crisply with consistent stroke weight and alignment; no off-brand glyphs. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headed), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Requires visual inspection of preview build; blocked. |
| P2 | Dark mode typography & contrast check | Validate dark theme color tokens preserve contrast ratios. | 1. Toggle dark theme. 2. Inspect headings, body copy, and syntax tokens. 3. Run axe contrast checks. | Text contrast meets WCAG AA; syntax highlighting remains legible. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headed), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – UI preview unavailable. |
| P3 | High DPI rendering review | Ensure UI scales gracefully on 200% zoom / retina displays. | 1. Set device pixel ratio to 2. 2. Inspect key components for blurriness. | Text, icons, and previews remain sharp; no bitmap scaling artifacts. | Desktop, Chromium 139 (headed), Ubuntu 22.04 | **Blocked** – Preview build blocked; cannot execute scenario. |

## 2. Test Execution Report

### 2.1 Execution Summary

| Activity | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test` | **Pass** – `scripts/validate-gui-test-plan.mjs` parsed the GUI test plan, verified section coverage, and confirmed that every scenario row carries an approved execution status label. Result artifacts are stored in `artifacts/gui-test-plan-validation.*`. |
| `npm install` | **Failed** – `node-plantuml` post-install script attempted to download `viz.js` from the public internet. The sandboxed environment has no outbound network access, causing an `ENETUNREACH` error and aborting dependency installation. 【90d68e†L1-L28】 |
| `npm run build` | **Blocked** – Build depends on Tailwind CLI and bundled assets generated by `npm install`. Because dependencies were not installed, the CLI is unavailable and the build cannot progress. 【f5260c†L1-L11】 |
| GUI scenario execution | **Blocked** – All manual and automated GUI flows listed in Section&nbsp;1 require the preview bundle produced by the build pipeline. Without dependencies and build artifacts, the application cannot be launched for testing. |

### 2.2 Impact on Scenario Coverage

- No scenarios in Section&nbsp;1 could be executed during this cycle. Every entry remains in a **Blocked** state and will require a rerun once dependency installation succeeds. The new documentation validation harness (see `npm test` above) ensures the matrix structure is kept current while we work to unblock the UI build.
- Historical bug evidence from earlier runs (autosave loss, mobile layout clipping, keyboard focus trap) has not been revalidated in this execution. Prior findings remain open and unverified.

### 2.3 Blocker Detail

- The `node-plantuml` package’s install script falls back to downloading `viz.js` when Graphviz binaries are absent. In offline CI environments, this results in an `ENETUNREACH` socket error. A local mirror or stubbed renderer is required to proceed.
- Because dependency installation aborted, the Tailwind CLI binary (`node_modules/.bin/tailwindcss`) is absent. As a result, `npm run build` terminates immediately when attempting to invoke Tailwind.

### 2.4 Mitigation Plan

1. Provide the `viz.js` artifact locally (check it into the repository or host it on an internal mirror) and configure `node-plantuml` to consume the offline asset so `npm install` can succeed in sandboxed CI.
2. Alternatively, stub or remove PlantUML integration for web-preview-only builds to avoid the network-dependent install script during documentation/test runs.
3. After addressing dependency installation, re-run `npm install`, `npm run build`, and the full GUI scenario suite to collect pass/fail evidence and screenshots.

### 2.5 Current Bug & Recommendation Status

| ID | Original Severity | Last Confirmed State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BUG-01 | Critical | Not re-tested | Awaiting rebuilt environment to verify whether autosave regression persists. |
| BUG-02 | High | Not re-tested | Requires responsive viewport checks once preview build is available. |
| BUG-03 | High | Not re-tested | Needs renewed keyboard navigation sweep when UI can load. |

### 2.6 Usability and Reliability Backlog

- Previously logged UX improvements (autosave confirmations, mobile navigation drawer, connection badge guidance, shortcut hints) remain outstanding; execution is paused until the environment issue is resolved.

### 2.7 Coverage Gaps and Next Steps

- **Coverage Achieved**: None this cycle due to build blocking issues.
- **Immediate Gaps**: All GUI validations, accessibility sweeps, and file-type onboarding scenarios are pending execution. Additionally, smoke build validation is blocked.
- **Next Steps**: Unblock dependency installation, regenerate build artifacts, then re-run the prioritized suite. Once executed, capture evidence and refresh Sections&nbsp;2.1–2.6 with results, defect updates, and screenshots.
- **Next Steps**: Unblock dependency installation, regenerate build artifacts, then re-run the prioritized suite. Once executed, capture evidence and refresh Sections&nbsp;2.1–2.6 with results, defect updates, and screenshots. Continue running the markdown validation script (`npm test`) in CI to ensure the expanded plan stays aligned with execution evidence.

### 2.8 Future Testing Strategy Recommendations (unchanged)

1. Automate core flows (create/edit/save, template preview) with Playwright plus visual assertions to guard against regressions.
2. Integrate axe-core accessibility scans and manual screen reader smoke tests into CI to enforce WCAG compliance.
3. Add responsive snapshot testing for critical breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile) to catch layout regressions early.
4. Expand manual testing to include touch devices and configurable AI providers to verify the status bar error clears correctly.
5. Implement fault-injection tests (mocked network/service failures) to validate error modals and recovery UX.
6. Build a shared fixture library and Playwright coverage for all supported file types (Markdown, HTML, PlantUML, PDF, PNG/JPG, plaintext) to prevent regression in document onboarding and preview rendering.
