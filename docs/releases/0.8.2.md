# v0.8.2 - The Antigravity Styling Update

**Release Date:** 2025-12-19

## Summary

This release introduces the Antigravity design language—a cleaner, VS Code-inspired aesthetic with sharper corners, reduced focus rings, and flatter UI elements. The Markdown preview zoom has been improved to properly reflow text, and tree selection visibility has been fixed in light mode.

## Improvements

### Antigravity Design Language

Applied a comprehensive styling update across the application for a more professional, IDE-like appearance:

-   **Sharper corners:** Buttons, modals, tooltips, dropdowns, and cards now use `rounded-sm` instead of `rounded-md`/`rounded-lg`.
-   **Reduced focus rings:** Focus indicators are now more subtle (1px, lower opacity) to avoid visual clutter.
-   **Flatter design:** Removed shadows from modals, tooltips, context menus, and dropdowns, relying on borders for definition.
-   **Status bar polish:** LLM provider/model selectors, database dropdown, and zoom buttons now use text-only hover/focus states instead of visible rings or backgrounds.

### Markdown Preview Zoom

Text now reflows properly when zooming in or out in the Markdown preview pane. This eliminates the whitespace issue that occurred when zooming out, where content would shrink but not reflow to use the available width.

### Tree Selection Visibility

Fixed the tree item selection highlight in light mode to be clearly visible. The previous implementation used 20% opacity on the selection color, making it nearly invisible.

## Fixes

-   **Scroll sync disabled:** Removed the scroll synchronization between the code editor and Markdown preview panes, as the sync behavior was unreliable. The panes now scroll independently.
-   **Search box styling:** Improved the sidebar search box with a subtle background, no visible border, and sharper corners for a more professional look.
