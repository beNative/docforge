# DocForge v0.7.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** 2025-11-11

## Summary
DocForge v0.7.0 focuses on smarter capture workflows and finer workspace control. Clipboard imports can now name themselves with the help of your connected LLM, the zoom controls follow whichever pane you are working in, and the logger panel gains powerful selection and export tools alongside an About dialog shortcut to the installation folder.

## ✨ New features
- **Clipboard title generation:** New-from-clipboard documents automatically request a concise title from your configured local LLM when it is connected, keeping captured snippets organized without extra typing. [#218](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/218)
- **Installation folder shortcut:** The About dialog now includes an "Open installation folder" button that leverages a new Electron bridge to reveal the directory where DocForge is running, simplifying support and troubleshooting. [#216](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/216)

## 🛠 Improvements
- **Focused workspace zoom:** Zoom controls, keyboard shortcuts, and the percentage indicator now follow the pane that currently has focus (editor or preview) and step in precise 5% increments. The status bar labels clearly communicate the active target. [#217](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/217)
- **Logger panel ergonomics:** Multi-select support, drag gestures, and a "Copy Selected" action with toggles for timestamps, log levels, and line breaks make it easy to export exactly the log data you need. [#215](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/215)
- **Folder overview polish:** The rename button in the Folder Overview adopts the same styling as adjacent controls for a cohesive toolbar. [#214](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/214)

## 🐛 Fixes
- **Consistent hover tooltips:** Restored the default tooltip styling for truncated sidebar titles so hover previews remain legible against all themes. [#219](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/219)
