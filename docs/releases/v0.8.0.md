# DocForge v0.8.0 Release Notes

**Release date:** 2025-11-18

## Summary
DocForge v0.8.0 introduces emoji-aware titles and richer command palette coverage so power users can personalize workspaces and trigger editor actions without leaving the keyboard. The release also polishes appearance controls, search result styling, and status reporting for a smoother daily workflow.

## ✨ New features
- **Emoji-enhanced titles:** Right-click any document or folder title to open an emoji picker, or run the new "Add AI Emoji Prefix" command to let your connected LLM suggest a single-character accent for the active document. [#238](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/238)
- **Expanded command palette:** Document editor commands—format, lock/unlock, manual save, AI refine, copy content, and emoji generation—now live in the palette so you can invoke them via search or custom shortcuts. [#247](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/247)

## 🛠 Improvements
- **Compact color picker:** Appearance settings use a lightweight palette picker that closes when you click outside the popover, making it faster to try new accent colors. [#239](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/239)
- **Readable search snippets:** Document body matches display against the theme background with a soft accent border that stays legible across light and dark palettes. [#233](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/233)
- **Helpful save indicator:** The status bar now shows a relative "Last Saved" timestamp with a tooltip that reveals the exact time on hover or focus. [#244](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/244)

## 🐛 Fixes
- Resolved a regression where document-specific command triggers were not reinitialized when switching files, ensuring palette actions fire reliably. [#247](https://github.com/beNative/docforge/pull/247)

## 📝 Documentation
- Refreshed the README, functional manual, and technical manual to cover emoji workflows, the new palette commands, and updated appearance controls ahead of the v0.8.0 release.
