# QA & Evidence Log: Consolidation & Defect Hardening

## Checklists

- [x] TypeScript strict mode enabled and `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors.
- [ ] ESLint + Prettier configuration enforced; `eslint .` and `npm run format:check` exit cleanly with zero warnings.
- [ ] All IPC channels documented and validated against shared schemas; Vitest suites cover success and failure cases.
- [ ] Centralized error handling prevents unhandled promise rejections and records structured logs.
- [ ] Windows and Linux packaging jobs succeed in CI and produce documented artifacts.
- [ ] Breaking refactors recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` with mitigation notes.
- [ ] Contributor and technical documentation updated to reflect new policies.
- [ ] Security and release engineering sign-offs captured below.
