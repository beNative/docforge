# Feature Specification: Consolidation & Defect Hardening

**Feature Branch**: `[004-consolidation-defect-hardening]`
**Created**: 2025-02-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: `/speckit.specify` directive "Consolidation & Defect Hardening" for the Electron + React/TypeScript desktop app.

## Vision & Context

DocForge has landed two major Spec Kit features over the past release cycle. The codebase needs a consolidation wave that
stabilizes core workflows, drives configuration parity, and eliminates latent defects before new functionality ships. This
feature aligns delivery teams around strict TypeScript guarantees, consistent linting/formatting, hardened IPC boundaries, and
predictable packaging across Windows and Linux. The initiative intentionally avoids net-new UX features, focusing instead on
systemic reliability and contributor confidence.

## Objectives

1. Deliver a zero-drift TypeScript toolchain with `strict` mode enabled and no implicit `any`/`unknown` escapes.
2. Reduce lint noise to zero by standardizing ESLint + Prettier configuration and enforcing a no-warning budget.
3. Inventory, document, and schema-validate every IPC request/response pair to prevent renderer/main contract regressions.
4. Ensure runtime stability by eliminating unhandled promise rejections and centralizing error logging.
5. Confirm desktop packaging pipelines succeed on Windows and Linux without manual patching.
6. Provide a transparent record of breaking refactors and mitigations in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## User Scenarios & Quality Outcomes

### Scenario 1 – Strict TypeScript adoption (Priority: P0)

A maintainer runs `npm run typecheck` after enabling `strict: true`. The compilation completes with zero errors and exposes no
implicit `any` or `unknown` gaps across the app, Electron processes, or Spec Kit helpers.

**Independent Test**: Execute `tsc --noEmit` in CI for Windows, Linux, and macOS runners; all succeed without suppressions.

### Scenario 2 – Linting parity enforcement (Priority: P0)

Contributors run `npm run lint` and see consistent results across machines. ESLint reports zero warnings, and formatting checks
(`npm run format:check`) confirm Prettier alignment.

**Independent Test**: Invoke `eslint .` and `npm run format:check` inside the CI pipeline; both exit successfully with no
warnings logged.

### Scenario 3 – IPC contract hardening (Priority: P0)

Security reviewers inspect main and renderer code paths. Every IPC channel lists its schema in shared modules, and payloads are
validated via Zod (or equivalent) before handlers execute. The documentation enumerates channel names, request/response shapes,
and expected error codes.

**Independent Test**: Run Vitest suites that send malformed IPC payloads; handlers reject them with structured errors while
logging via the central error bus.

### Scenario 4 – Runtime resilience (Priority: P1)

During background sync, a service throws an error. The centralized error logger captures the rejection, records structured
metadata, and prevents unhandled promise rejection warnings. UI state remains responsive.

**Independent Test**: Simulate rejected promises in renderer and main process tests; verify single-log capture and absence of
unhandled rejection warnings in console output.

### Scenario 5 – Cross-platform packaging assurance (Priority: P1)

Release engineering runs `npm run package:win` and `npm run package:linux`. Both builds succeed using hardened preload scripts
and emit artifacts with documented checksums.

**Independent Test**: Execute packaging jobs in CI matrix builds (Windows/Linux) and archive artifacts; failures block the merge.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Enable TypeScript `strict: true` (plus complementary flags such as `noImplicitOverride`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
  and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`) and resolve resulting type errors so `tsc --noEmit` passes cleanly.
- **FR-002**: Install/configure ESLint + Prettier with a zero-warning policy (`max-warnings=0`) and provide scripts for linting,
  formatting, and format checks. Document the workflow in contributor guides.
- **FR-003**: Audit every IPC channel. Create shared request/response schema modules (Zod or equivalent), update handlers to
  validate payloads, and publish channel documentation within the repo.
- **FR-004**: Introduce or extend centralized error handling for renderer and main processes, ensuring no unhandled promise
  rejections reach the runtime. Route errors through a logging service with redaction support.
- **FR-005**: Harden build tooling so Windows and Linux packaging commands succeed without manual intervention; update CI to run
  these jobs on release branches.
- **FR-006**: Record all breaking API or configuration changes in `CHANGELOG.md`, including migration steps and mitigation
  guidance for downstream consumers.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Maintain quality suite runtime under five minutes per platform in CI.
- **NFR-002**: Ensure IPC validation tests cover 100% of documented channels with both success and failure paths.
- **NFR-003**: Centralized logging must avoid leaking sensitive file paths or user data; include redaction utilities where
  necessary.
- **NFR-004**: Keep the zero-warning ESLint configuration documented so contributors understand remediation steps.

## Deliverables

1. Updated `tsconfig.json`, ESLint, and Prettier configuration enforcing strict typing and formatting policies.
2. Refactored TypeScript sources resolving new strict-mode diagnostics.
3. Shared IPC schema modules with accompanying documentation (`docs/` or `specs/004.../contracts/`).
4. Central error/logging utilities adopted across Electron main, preload, and renderer layers.
5. CI pipeline updates exercising `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint .`, relevant Vitest suites, and Windows/Linux packaging.
6. `CHANGELOG.md` entries capturing breaking changes and consolidation impacts.
7. QA evidence stored in `specs/004-consolidation-defect-hardening/qa.md`, including test logs and packaging artifacts.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Enabling strict TypeScript may uncover extensive typing gaps.
  - *Mitigation*: Stage changes by feature area, leverage temporary `@ts-expect-error` annotations with tracked follow-up tasks,
    and pair with senior maintainers.
- **Risk**: IPC documentation drifts from implementation.
  - *Mitigation*: Co-locate schema definitions with docs, add CI checks comparing documented channel lists to source exports.
- **Risk**: Packaging pipelines increase CI duration.
  - *Mitigation*: Run packaging on a nightly or release branch schedule with caching to keep mainline pipelines efficient.
- **Risk**: Centralizing error handling might mask existing bespoke logging flows.
  - *Mitigation*: Provide adapter hooks and log parity tests to ensure legacy signals remain observable.

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: `tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors across supported operating systems.
- **SC-002**: `eslint .` completes with zero warnings; CI treats new warnings as failures.
- **SC-003**: Documentation enumerates every IPC channel with schema references, and automated tests verify schema enforcement.
- **SC-004**: Observability dashboards (or logs) show zero unhandled promise rejection entries during soak testing.
- **SC-005**: Windows and Linux packaging jobs succeed twice consecutively in CI without manual intervention.
- **SC-006**: `CHANGELOG.md` reflects all breaking refactors with remediation notes approved by release engineering.
