# Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Why | Concrete Fix | FR+Task Linkage |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|-----|---------------|-----------------|
| F1 | Coverage & Tooling | HIGH | specs/002-new-feature-new/tasks.md:9-13,75-79; package.json:6-24 | Multiple tasks list `npm run lint` as an acceptance gate, but the workspace defines no `lint` script, so these checks cannot be executed to validate clipboard flows. | Replace the nonexistent lint command with a real quality gate (e.g., add an ESLint script) or update acceptance checks to reference available tooling before implementation begins. | FR-002/FR-006 via T-ARCH-01 and T-TEST-01. |
| F2 | Coverage & Tooling | HIGH | specs/002-new-feature-new/tasks.md:14-67,78-83; package.json:6-16 | Architecture, data, UI, and test tasks rely on `npm run test -- --runInBand --filter …`, but the `test` script delegates to `scripts/validate-gui-test-plan.mjs` which does not accept Jest-style flags, leaving the majority of functional requirements without verifiable acceptance tests. | Align acceptance checks with executable commands (e.g., document how to target validations inside `validate-gui-test-plan.mjs` or introduce scoped test runners) so each FR-backed task has a runnable test gate. | FR-001/FR-002/FR-003/FR-004/FR-005/FR-006/FR-007 via T-ARCH-02, T-ARCH-03, T-ARCH-04, T-DATA-02, T-UI-01, T-UI-02, T-UI-03, T-TEST-01, T-TEST-02. |
| F3 | Coverage & Tooling | HIGH | specs/002-new-feature-new/tasks.md:85-88; package.json:6-24 | The end-to-end task mandates `npm run test:e2e`, but no such script exists in the project, preventing confirmation of undo behavior and multi-entrypoint coverage required by FR-001/FR-003/FR-005/FR-007. | Define an `test:e2e` script (or reference an existing equivalent) so QA can execute the promised scenario coverage before release. | FR-001/FR-003/FR-005/FR-007 via T-TEST-03. |

**Coverage Summary Table:**

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| FR-001 | Yes | T-UI-01, T-UI-02, T-TEST-03 | Acceptance checks in F2/F3 currently non-executable. |
| FR-002 | Yes | T-ARCH-01, T-ARCH-03, T-DATA-01, T-TEST-01, T-REL-02 | Lint/test tooling gaps flagged in F1/F2. |
| FR-003 | Yes | T-ARCH-02, T-DATA-02, T-UI-02, T-TEST-03 | Impacted by non-runnable tests in F2/F3. |
| FR-004 | Yes | T-ARCH-04, T-TEST-02 | Impacted by non-runnable tests in F2. |
| FR-005 | Yes | T-ARCH-02, T-UI-01, T-UI-02, T-TEST-03 | Impacted by non-runnable tests in F2/F3. |
| FR-006 | Yes | T-ARCH-01, T-ARCH-03, T-DATA-01, T-UI-03, T-TEST-01, T-REL-02 | Impacted by tooling gaps in F1/F2. |
| FR-007 | Yes | T-ARCH-02, T-DATA-02, T-TEST-03 | Impacted by non-runnable tests in F2/F3. |
| FR-008 | Yes | T-REL-01 | No findings. |

**Constitution Alignment Issues:** None identified.

**Unmapped Tasks:** None.

**Metrics:**
- Total Requirements: 8
- Total Tasks: 14
- Coverage % (requirements with ≥1 task): 100%
- Ambiguity Count: 0
- Duplication Count: 0
- Critical Issues Count: 0

**Next Actions:**
- Resolve F1–F3 by updating tasks.md (and supporting tooling) so every acceptance check maps to a runnable script before implementation proceeds.
- Once tooling gaps are addressed, rerun `/speckit.analyze` to confirm no residual coverage issues remain.
