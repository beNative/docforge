# Feature Specification: DocForge Quality & Consistency Sweep (Q4 2025)

**Feature Branch**: `[003-docforge-quality-consistency-sweep-q4-2025]`
**Created**: 2025-02-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: `/speckit.constitution` directive "DocForge Quality & Consistency Sweep (Q4 2025)" with governance and engineering guardrails.

## Vision & Context

DocForge must maintain a hardened, predictable foundation as new workflows ship. This Q4 2025 sweep aligns the desktop app and
spec authoring surfaces with modern TypeScript, linting, security, and operations expectations. The work consolidates engineering
policy gaps, removes brittle defaults, and documents the enforcement mechanisms so the next release cycle starts with a clean,
trustworthy baseline.

## Objectives

1. Enforce strict TypeScript typing and catch implicit-any regressions during CI.
2. Harmonize linting and formatting with ESLint + Prettier and a zero-warning budget.
3. Lock down the Electron shell to comply with security guidance (context isolation, IPC contracts, no `remote`, no sync calls).
4. Establish reliable error handling, logging, and filesystem/database hygiene policies.
5. Guarantee packaging builds for Windows and Linux and publish smoke tests for utilities and IPC schemas.

## User Scenarios & Quality Outcomes

### Scenario 1 – Developer onboarding on a fresh clone (Priority: P0)

A new contributor clones DocForge, installs dependencies, and runs the standard quality suite. TypeScript compilation, linting, and
tests pass with no configuration changes or cascading warnings.

**Independent Test**: Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test:smoke` on macOS, Windows, and Linux CI runners; all
exit with code `0` and no warnings.

### Scenario 2 – Desktop security review (Priority: P0)

A security auditor inspects the Electron preload and IPC bridge. Context isolation is enabled, the renderer has no privileged
APIs, and every IPC channel validates payloads using shared Zod schemas. No synchronous or `remote` APIs exist.

**Independent Test**: Review `electron/main.ts`, `electron/preload.ts`, and IPC schema modules. Attempt to send malformed payloads
in tests; expect validation failures and structured logging.

### Scenario 3 – Runtime failure handling (Priority: P1)

A production error occurs during filesystem access. The central error handler captures the exception, emits a structured log entry,
and surfaces a non-blocking notification. No unhandled promise rejection warnings appear in the console.

**Independent Test**: Simulate a rejected promise in a background service; verify the global error bus logs it once, and UI keeps
running.

### Scenario 4 – Packaging QA (Priority: P1)

Release engineering triggers the desktop packaging pipeline for Windows (NSIS) and Linux (AppImage). Builds succeed without manual
patching and include the updated preload scripts.

**Independent Test**: Run `npm run package:win` and `npm run package:linux` within CI (matrix jobs) and verify artifacts generate
successfully.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Enable TypeScript `strict: true` (and supporting flags) in `tsconfig.json`. Resolve all implicit `any`/`unknown`
  issues across app, Electron, and spec tooling sources so `tsc --noEmit` passes without errors.
- **FR-002**: Replace ad-hoc lint/format configurations with a combined ESLint + Prettier setup. CI must fail on any lint warning
  or formatting drift. Provide `npm run lint` and `npm run format` scripts and document usage in `README.md`.
- **FR-003**: Refactor Electron entrypoints to enforce `contextIsolation: true`, disable `nodeIntegration`, remove legacy `remote`
  imports, and expose only hardened IPC surfaces backed by shared schema validators (Zod or equivalent). Reject synchronous IPC.
- **FR-004**: Establish centralized error handling for renderer and main processes. Capture unhandled rejections, route them through
  a logging service, and surface user-safe notifications. Update services to propagate errors to the handler rather than silently
  swallowing them.
- **FR-005**: Audit filesystem and database calls to ensure sanitized inputs, normalized paths, and parameterized SQL (if used).
  Introduce helper utilities or wrappers enforcing these constraints.
- **FR-006**: Author smoke tests (Vitest or equivalent) covering utility modules (e.g., path sanitization, error bus) and IPC schema
  validators. Tests must run in CI as part of the quality suite.
- **FR-007**: Update build tooling to ensure `npm run package:win` and `npm run package:linux` succeed using the hardened Electron
  settings. Document platform prerequisites and expected outputs.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Quality suite completion time must remain under 5 minutes on a typical CI runner.
- **NFR-002**: Security review artifacts (e.g., IPC contract diagrams, validator coverage) must be linked from the spec folder.
- **NFR-003**: Logging must avoid leaking sensitive file paths or user content; redact where necessary.
- **NFR-004**: Documentation updates must highlight new guardrails in `TECHNICAL_MANUAL.md` and contributor guides.

## Deliverables

1. Updated configuration files (`tsconfig.json`, ESLint/Prettier configs, CI workflows) enforcing the policies.
2. Refactored Electron main and preload code with schema-validated IPC utilities.
3. Centralized error-handling modules shared across renderer and main processes.
4. Sanitization helpers for filesystem/database interactions and accompanying smoke tests.
5. Packaging scripts verified for Windows and Linux, with documentation and troubleshooting notes.
6. QA evidence: test run logs, IPC validator test reports, and security checklist stored in `qa.md`.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Strict TypeScript mode introduces large refactor workload.
  - *Mitigation*: Prioritize shared types, add incremental `@ts-expect-error` annotations only with follow-up tasks.
- **Risk**: Packaging changes could break auto-update channels.
  - *Mitigation*: Coordinate with release engineering; stage packaging in a release candidate branch before tagging.
- **Risk**: Schema validation overhead might impact IPC performance.
  - *Mitigation*: Benchmark IPC handlers; cache compiled schemas when necessary.

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: CI passes `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run test:smoke`, and packaging jobs on Windows/Linux.
- **SC-002**: Security audit checklist shows zero high-severity findings related to Electron shell or IPC.
- **SC-003**: No unhandled promise rejection warnings observed in integration logs during one-week soak test.
- **SC-004**: QA report confirms filesystem/database calls route through sanitization helpers in 100% sampled cases.
- **SC-005**: Contributor survey (post-release) reports ≥90% satisfaction with onboarding clarity for quality tooling.
