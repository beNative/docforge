# Task Breakdown: DocForge Quality & Consistency Sweep (Q4 2025)

## Governance Workflow

1. Review this specification with engineering, security, and release stakeholders.
2. Produce a detailed implementation plan outlining sequencing (TypeScript, linting, Electron hardening, testing, packaging).
3. Upon any scope changes, re-run the plan → tasks → analysis loop per governance directive before coding begins.

## Workstreams & Tasks

### 1. TypeScript Hardening
- Audit `tsconfig.json` settings and enable `strict: true`, `noImplicitOverride`, `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`, and related guards.
- Refactor application, Electron, and tooling TypeScript files to resolve implicit `any`/`unknown` issues.
- Update shared type definitions and eliminate dead code surfaced by the stricter compiler.
- Add `npm run typecheck` script (alias for `tsc --noEmit`) and wire it into CI.

### 2. Linting & Formatting Alignment
- Install/update ESLint + Prettier with project-specific configs.
- Configure ESLint to treat warnings as errors (max warnings = 0) and ensure Prettier integration via `eslint-plugin-prettier` or `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` if needed.
- Introduce `npm run lint`, `npm run format`, and `npm run format:check` scripts.
- Update contributor documentation describing the workflow and zero-warning policy.

### 3. Electron Security Hardening
- Review `electron/main.ts`, `preload.ts`, and IPC modules to enforce `contextIsolation: true`, disable `nodeIntegration`, and remove any `remote` usage.
- Implement shared schema validation (Zod or similar) for each IPC channel; reject synchronous IPC calls.
- Document IPC contract definitions and expected request/response payloads.
- Add Vitest smoke tests that exercise IPC validators with valid and invalid payloads.

### 4. Centralized Error Handling & Logging
- Introduce a unified error bus accessible from renderer, preload, and main processes.
- Wrap existing async operations to ensure rejected promises propagate to the handler; remove ad-hoc `catch` blocks that swallow errors.
- Emit structured logs (e.g., JSON) with sanitized payloads, and surface user notifications for recoverable errors.
- Document escalation paths and logging sinks in the technical manual.

### 5. Filesystem/Database Hygiene
- Inventory filesystem and database access points (services, utilities).
- Implement path normalization and input sanitization helpers; update callers to use them.
- Verify database interactions (if applicable) use parameterized queries only.
- Add unit smoke tests covering sanitization edge cases.

### 6. Build & Packaging Verification
- Update packaging scripts/configuration for Windows (NSIS) and Linux (AppImage) to include hardened preload and environment settings.
- Run packaging jobs in CI matrix; capture artifacts and publish checksums.
- Document prerequisites and troubleshooting steps for each platform.

### 7. Documentation & QA Artifacts
- Update `README.md`, `TECHNICAL_MANUAL.md`, and contributor docs to reflect new tooling, scripts, and policies.
- Record validation evidence (test logs, audit notes, packaging results) in `qa.md`.
- Prepare release notes summarizing the sweep outcomes.

## Completion Definition

Workstream owners must provide:
- Passing CI runs demonstrating type checking, linting, formatting checks, smoke tests, and packaging builds.
- Updated documentation merged alongside code changes.
- QA evidence stored in `specs/003-docforge-quality-consistency-sweep-q4-2025/qa.md`.
- Sign-off from security and release engineering stakeholders recorded in the QA log.
